Few Bugs Noticed
score percentage returned in the console debug is not shown on UI and instead it shows the date which is not localised to the user (American format of date)
* potentially wrong config of DB field for date

Guilty / Non Guilty radio buttons are inverted
* Also suggestion to add a change answer button

Font colour on continue > button is wrong colour and hard to read

Future Testing
* Implement further automated test coverage
* UI Automation of vimeo iframe
* Browser / device coverage IE - opera, mobile, tablet, etc (currently will test chromium, firefox)
* Most element cards are popup modals, be interesting to see how they interact with a popup blocker enabled.
* Load testing of site performance
* Progression caching when page reloads or closes unexpectedly
